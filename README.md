# Code Challenge
## Contacts Client

To get this running locally, use NVM to get the right version of node installed
1. copy the `.env.example` and create `.env`.
1. Since this project uses the Google Maps API, you'll need to add the google
 Maps API key in the `.env` for it to works. Feel free to modify the `.env` values
 as needed.
1. After completing the above, complete the install;
   1. `nvm use`
   1. `npm i`
   1. `npm run prod` or `npm run dev`
   1. `npm run serve`

You can also run this app through `Docker` :)


Enjoy!
